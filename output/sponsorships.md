### The Impact of Your Support

As Open WebUI continues to grow, so do the challenges and tasks we face. Tim, the driving force behind this project, works tirelessly to ensure that all aspects of Open WebUI function smoothly and thrive.

#### Benefits for Sponsors
- **Enhanced Features:** Contributions allow us to focus more on refining features.
- **Resource Management:** Less time spent managing resources means more time dedicated to development.
- **Community Alignment:** Your support helps align our daily realities with ambitious goals, making a meaningful difference in the project's trajectory.

#### Gratitude for Current Sponsors
We are incredibly grateful to our current sponsors. Their commitment has brought us closer to realizing the full potential of Open WebUI. Every contribution, no matter the size, strengthens the project and lays the groundwork for its continued success.

### Sponsorship Policies

At Open WebUI, our community always comes first. Our sponsorship policies are designed with this philosophy in mind.

#### Hard Rules
These rules are non-negotiable:
- **Clear Identification:** Sponsors will always be clearly identified as such.
- **No Aggressive Sales Tactics:** Directing aggressive sales tactics at community members is strictly prohibited.
- **Privacy Protection:** Personal information about our community members will not be sold to sponsors.

#### Soft Rules
- **Community Engagement:** Sponsors are expected to be exemplary community members. Subtle promotion of job openings or products is acceptable, but hard selling is not allowed.
- **No Mailing List Requests:** Do not ask community members to join your mailing list.

## Summary

Sponsorship plays a crucial role in the growth and development of Open WebUI. By supporting the project, sponsors help refine features, manage resources effectively, and align daily operations with ambitious goals. The sponsorship policies ensure that the community remains the top priority, fostering a respectful and beneficial relationship between sponsors and community members.

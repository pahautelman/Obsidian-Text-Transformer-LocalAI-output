### Why Evaluate Models?

Evaluating models is crucial because:
- There are numerous AI models available, each with different strengths.
- Public leaderboards may not always reflect a model's performance in your specific context.
- Some models might be trained on evaluation datasets, affecting results.

**Example Scenario:**
Meet Alex, a machine learning engineer who needs to choose the best model for their company. They can't rely solely on public leaderboards because:
- Models perform differently based on context.
- Some models may have been trained on the same data used for evaluation.
- The writing style of some models might not fit well.

### Open WebUI Evaluation System

Open WebUI provides a built-in evaluation system to help users find the best model for their needs. Here’s how it works:

1. **Thumbs Up/Down Rating:**
   - During chats, rate responses with thumbs up or down.
   - This contributes to your personalized leaderboard.

2. **Personalized Leaderboard:**
   - Accessible in the Admin section.
   - Helps track which models perform best for your team.

3. **Model Fine-Tuning:**
   - Snapshots of rated chats are used for future model fine-tuning.
   - Ensures continuous improvement based on user feedback.

### Evaluation Options

1. **Arena Model:**
   - Randomly selects models for comparison.
   - Ensures fair and unbiased evaluation.
   - Requires sibling messages (alternative responses) for leaderboard impact.

2. **Normal Interaction:**
   - Rate responses during everyday chats.
   - Needs model swaps to influence the leaderboard.

### Leaderboard and Topic-Based Reranking

- **Leaderboard:**
  - Visual representation of model performance using an Elo rating system.
  - Accessible under the Admin Panel.

- **Topic-Based Reranking:**
  - Tag chats by topic for granular insights.
  - Automatically tags conversations based on context, but manual tagging is recommended for accuracy.
  - Allows re-ranking models based on specific topics (e.g., technical support vs. customer inquiries).

### Chat Snapshots for Model Fine-Tuning

- Whenever you rate a response, Open WebUI captures a snapshot of the chat.
- These snapshots can be used to fine-tune models, feeding user evaluations into continuous improvement.

## Summary
Open WebUI’s evaluation system helps users easily compare AI models and find the best fit for their specific needs. With options like the Arena Model and Normal Interaction, users have full control over determining which model works best. The system ensures simplicity, transparency, and customization while prioritizing user privacy and data autonomy.

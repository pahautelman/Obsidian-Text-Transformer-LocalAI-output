# Tools & Functions

## Key Concepts
- Tools (extending LLM abilities)
  - Real-time data collection
  - Examples: weather updates, stock prices, flight tracking
- Functions (extending Open WebUI capabilities)
  - Adding new AI models
  - Customizing interface and behavior
  - Examples: custom buttons, filters
- Pipelines (advanced API-compatible workflows)

## Detailed Description

**Reference:** [https://docs.openwebui.com/features/plugin/](https://docs.openwebui.com/features/plugin/)

### Overview
This document explains the concepts of **Tools**, **Functions**, and **Pipelines** in Open WebUI, detailing how they extend the capabilities of both Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Open WebUI platform itself.

### Tools

#### Definition
Tools enhance LLMs by enabling them to gather real-world, real-time data. They act as plugins that allow LLMs to perform tasks beyond their pre-trained knowledge.

#### Examples
- **Weather Updates:** Retrieve live weather information.
- **Stock Prices:** Get real-time stock market data.
- **Flight Tracking:** Monitor flight statuses in real time.

### Functions

#### Definition
Functions extend the capabilities of Open WebUI itself, allowing users to add new features or customize existing ones. Unlike tools, functions do not enhance LLM abilities but rather improve the platform's interface and behavior.

#### Examples
- **Adding New AI Models:** Integrate models like Anthropic or Vertex AI.
- **Custom Buttons:** Create buttons for frequently used commands.
- **Filters:** Implement advanced filtering to catch inappropriate messages.

### Pipelines

#### Definition
Pipelines are advanced features that transform Open WebUI functionalities into API-compatible workflows. They are primarily used for offloading heavy processing tasks from the main system.

#### Use Cases
- **Advanced Users:** Experts dealing with complex setups.
- **Processing Offload:** Moving intensive tasks to different machines to prevent overloading the primary system.

### Getting Started

1. **Ease of Use:**
   - Tools and functions are integrated into the core system, making them easy to import from the community without requiring coding skills.

2. **Exploration:**
   - Encourages users to experiment with tools like weather updates or custom buttons to experience the flexibility and power of Open WebUI.

## Summary
Tools in Open WebUI extend LLM capabilities by enabling real-time data collection, while functions enhance the platform itself by adding new features and customizations. Pipelines offer advanced API-compatible workflows for offloading heavy processing tasks, though they are typically used by experts.

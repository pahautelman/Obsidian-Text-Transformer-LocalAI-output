## Detailed Description

**Reference:** [https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/network-diagrams](https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/network-diagrams)

### Overview
This documentation provides clear and structured diagrams to help users understand how various components of the network interact within different setups. The diagrams are designed to assist both macOS/Windows and Linux users, illustrating different deployment strategies and networking configurations.

### Visualization with Mermaid Diagrams

The interactions are visualized using **Mermaid diagrams**, which offer a clear representation of network setups depending on system configurations.

### macOS/Windows Setup Options

#### Ollama on Host, Open WebUI in Container
- **Ollama** runs directly on the host machine.
- **Open WebUI** operates within a Docker container.

#### Ollama and Open WebUI in Compose Stack
- Both **Ollama** and **Open WebUI** are configured within the same Docker Compose stack, simplifying network communications.

#### Ollama and Open WebUI, Separate Networks
- **Ollama** and **Open WebUI** are deployed in separate Docker networks, which may lead to connectivity issues.

#### Open WebUI in Host Network
- **Open WebUI** utilizes the host network, impacting its ability to connect in certain environments.

### Linux Setup Options

#### Ollama on Host, Open WebUI in Container (Linux)
- Specific to the Linux platform, with **Ollama** running on the host and **Open WebUI** deployed inside a Docker container.

#### Ollama and Open WebUI in Compose Stack (Linux)
- Both **Ollama** and **Open WebUI** reside within the same Docker Compose stack, allowing for straightforward networking on Linux.

#### Ollama and Open WebUI, Separate Networks (Linux)
- **Ollama** and **Open WebUI** are in different Docker networks under a Linux environment, which could hinder connectivity.

#### Open WebUI in Host Network, Ollama on Host (Linux)
- Both **Open WebUI** and **Ollama** use the hostâ€™s network, facilitating seamless interaction on Linux systems.

## Summary
This documentation provides detailed network diagrams to help users understand various deployment strategies and networking configurations for both macOS/Windows and Linux setups. The diagrams are visualized using Mermaid diagrams, making it easier to grasp the interactions between different components.

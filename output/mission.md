### Founder's Note
Before exploring our mission, read Tim’s blog post: "Why I’m Building Open WebUI." This post delves into the inspiration, challenges, and hopes driving Open WebUI's vision.

### Vision for AI
Imagine a world where local, open models running on any machine outperform proprietary giants like GPT-4. Our goal is to enable everyone to train and reproduce state-of-the-art models using high-quality, curated data.

### Challenges in Model Creation
Creating foundation and fine-tune models requires substantial high-quality data, which is costly and time-consuming to gather and curate. Open WebUI addresses this challenge by crowdsourcing curated datasets from our community.

### Our Mission
Our mission is to democratize AI by developing an easy-to-install, feature-rich local WebUI that operates without internet access. This makes AI accessible to anyone with basic technical skills, bringing its capabilities to communities worldwide.

### Commitment to Accessibility
We are committed to making AI not only accessible but also beneficial for everyone. Our vision is a future where AI drives societal advancement and technological breakthroughs across all communities.

### Eliminating Technological Barriers
By removing barriers and making AI's advantages universally accessible, we aim to foster positive global impact. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that AI serves as a catalyst for positive change, bridging gaps and creating a more equitable society.

### Vision: Shaping the Future Together
Our mission extends beyond developing our WebUI; we are building an ecosystem that embodies the democratization of AI technology. This community-driven platform will be a repository of shared knowledge, including model presets, custom prompts, and valuable chat logs.

### Community-Driven Innovation
Leveraging collective skills and insights, we'll forge innovative pathways to enhance the precision and relevance of AI models. Our objective is to democratize access to refined, user-curated datasets, eliminating barriers to advancing AI for all.

## Summary

Open WebUI's mission is to democratize AI by creating an accessible, local WebUI that operates without internet access. By crowdsourcing curated datasets and fostering a community-driven ecosystem, we aim to make AI beneficial for everyone, driving societal advancement and technological breakthroughs worldwide.

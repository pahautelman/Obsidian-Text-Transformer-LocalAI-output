### Interface Innovations

#### ReACT Tool Calling Support
The platform will implement **ReACT (Reasoning + Acting)** for on-the-fly tool function calling, enabling models to dynamically interact with external tools in real-time during conversations. This advanced capability will make workflows more interactive and efficient, streamlining problem-solving within the ecosystem.

#### MCP Tools Support
Introducing support for the **MCP framework** to establish seamless communication and context tracking across interconnected AI systems and modules. This ensures that context is preserved, workflows are maintained, and tools function cohesively, reducing the need for manual intervention or reinitialization.

#### Packaged Single Binary Executable
Simplifying deployment and ensuring compatibility across different platforms, we aim to offer our interface as a single binary executable. This approach will facilitate effortless installation and updates, significantly enhancing usability for all users, especially those with limited technical expertise.

### User Features

#### User Page
A personal **User Page** feature where users can create posts. The functionality will also include features like followers, likes, and comments. This allows users to effectively share their model configurations, prompts, and files with a broader community, creating a richer, more connected ecosystem around the platform.

#### AI Powered Notes
Inspired by tools like Notion and Obsidian, we plan to introduce a robust note-taking feature that includes AI integration. From simple note-taking to full-fledged document creation, this tool will offer a seamless experience, all locally integrated within the platform.

#### Advanced User Tracking and Cost Management Tools
Users will gain access to comprehensive tools designed for tracking application performance and user activities, as well as managing costs effectively. These tools will empower users with the data they need to make informed decisions, improve user experiences, and maintain budget control, optimizing the use of resources across their AI applications.

### Accessibility Enhancements

#### Local Text-to-Speech Integration
This feature will allow natural language processing to convert text into lifelike spoken audio, thus making the platform more accessible, especially for visually impaired users. This integration helps in consuming information without screen interaction, facilitating multitasking and improving user engagement.

#### Wakeword Detection
Incorporating hands-free operation through voice commands will not only enhance accessibility but also align with emerging trends in IoT and smart environments, making our platform future-ready.

### Development Tools

#### Code Interpreter Function
A flexible code interpreter embedded into the platform can support multiple programming languages, which reduces the dependency on external tools and streamlines the development process, increasing efficiency.

#### Streamlined Fine-tune Support
Open WebUI will offer a seamless fine-tuning process by allowing users to automatically build a fine-tune dataset simply by using the interface and rating the responses. We will provide Python notebooks to help preprocess your dataset, making it ready for fine-tuning directly from the notebook. This approach will be super simple and elegantly integrates fine-tuning into user workflows.

### Information Retrieval Improvements

#### Customizable RAG Framework
Envision a future where you can effortlessly tailor your IR setup via a user-friendly interface. This will include modular components that users can drag, drop, and configure without needing deep technical knowledge.

#### Advanced Integration with SoTA Methods
We aim to incorporate the latest developments in retrieval methods, enhancing accuracy and efficiency with advanced techniques and architectures.

#### Dedicated R&D
Weâ€™re scaling up our research and development to discover and integrate novel retrieval methods that push the boundaries of current methods, in collaboration with leading research entities.

### Community Engagement Strategies

#### LLM Leaderboard
A community-driven approach to evaluate and rank models ensures transparency and continuous improvement, leveraging real-world applications to benchmark performance instead of relying on standard datasets that might not reflect practical utility.

#### Sub-Communities
Encouraging niche communities to curate datasets and optimize prompts can lead to better-tuned models, as these communities have specific insights and detailed feedback that typically go unnoticed in broader datasets.

## Summary

The roadmap for Open WebUI outlines a series of ambitious features aimed at enhancing the platform's usability, accessibility, and community engagement. Key innovations include ReACT Tool Calling Support, MCP Tools Support, and a Single Binary Executable for easier deployment. User-centric features like AI Powered Notes and Advanced Tracking Tools are designed to improve user experience. Accessibility enhancements such as Text-to-Speech Integration and Wakeword Detection make the platform more inclusive. Development tools like Code Interpreter Function and Streamlined Fine-tune Support streamline workflows for developers. Information Retrieval improvements focus on a customizable RAG framework and advanced integration with state-of-the-art methods. Community engagement strategies include an LLM Leaderboard and support for sub-communities to foster a collaborative ecosystem.

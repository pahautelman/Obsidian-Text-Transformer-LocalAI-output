## Detailed Description

**Reference:** [https://docs.openwebui.com/faq](https://docs.openwebui.com/faq)

### Why Docker?

Docker is central to the project's design for several reasons:
- **Consistency**: Ensures that the environment remains consistent across different deployments.
- **Isolation**: Isolates dependencies, reducing compatibility issues.
- **Simplicity**: Simplifies deployment processes.

> **Note:** While Docker might not be everyoneâ€™s preference, it is fundamental to the project's operational efficiency. Community-driven alternatives are available for those seeking different deployment methods.

### Customizing Logo and Branding

To customize the logo and branding:
- **Enterprise License**: Required for customization.
- **Contact Sales**: For more details, contact sales@openwebui.com.

### Data Privacy and Security

Sign-up is required to enhance security:
- **Local Storage**: All data remains on your server; nothing is collected by Open WebUI.
- **Privacy Assurance**: Your data stays within your device, ensuring complete control over your information.

### Networking Within Docker Containers

**Connecting to Host Services**:
- Use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` inside the container to connect to host services.

**Making Host Services Accessible**:
- Configure services to listen on all network interfaces using `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`.

### Updating Open WebUI

Updating involves:
1. **Pulling the New Image**: Use `docker pull ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main`.
2. **Removing Old Container**: Without deleting the volume.
3. **Creating a New Container**: With the updated image and existing volume.

> **Important:** This process updates the application while preserving your data.

### Managing Docker Volumes

**Data Preservation**:
- Docker volumes persist data outside of container lifecycles.
- Ensure you do not delete the volume with commands like `docker volume rm`.

### GPU Support in Docker

GPU support varies by platform:
- **Supported**: Docker for Windows and Docker Engine on Linux.
- **Not Supported**: Docker Desktop for Linux and MacOS.

### Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS)

These services require HTTPS to function correctly due to browser security measures. Ensure your deployment is accessible over HTTPS.

### HTTPS Support

Open WebUI does not include built-in HTTPS support to allow for greater flexibility and customization. Users are encouraged to implement HTTPS termination based on their specific needs.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**SSL Errors**:
- Use a HuggingFace mirror like `hf-mirror.com` and specify it in the Docker run command with `-e HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com/`.

**Login Issues**:
- Ensure Docker volumes are correctly mounted to persist data.
- Recover admin account using the Resetting the Admin Password guide if needed.

## Summary

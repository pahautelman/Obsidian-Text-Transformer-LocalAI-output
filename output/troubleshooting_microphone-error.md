# Troubleshooting Microphone Access

## Key Concepts
- Secure contexts (HTTPS)
- Microphone access permissions
- Browser settings for non-HTTPS connections
- Security risks of temporary browser flags

## Detailed Description

**Reference:** [https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/microphone-error](https://docs.openwebui.com/troubleshooting/microphone-error)

### Understanding Secure Contexts
Microphone access is restricted to secure contexts for data protection. This means:
- Microphone permissions are only granted on pages served over HTTPS.
- Localhost connections are also considered secure.

### Common Permission Issues
Browsers like Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, and Firefox restrict microphone access on non-HTTPS URLs. This is common when accessing a site from another device within the same network (e.g., mobile phone to desktop server).

### Solutions for Non-HTTPS Connections

#### Set Up HTTPS
- **Recommendation:** Configure your server to support HTTPS.
  - Enhances data security.
  - Resolves permission issues.

#### Temporary Browser Flags (Use with Caution)
These settings force browsers to treat insecure URLs as secure. Useful for development but poses significant security risks.

##### Chromium-based Browsers (e.g., Chrome, Brave)

1. Open `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`.
2. Enter your non-HTTPS address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.35:3000`).
3. Restart the browser to apply changes.

##### Firefox-based Browsers

1. Open `about:config`.
2. Search and modify (or create) the string value `dom.securecontext.allowlist`.
3. Add your IP addresses separated by commas (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).

### Considerations and Risks
- **Security Risks:** Temporary browser flags bypass important security checks, exposing devices and data to vulnerabilities.
- **Best Practices:** Always prioritize proper security measures, especially for production environments.

## Summary

To troubleshoot microphone access issues, ensure your application is served over HTTPS. For development purposes, you can use temporary browser flags, but be aware of the associated security risks. Prioritizing secure contexts and proper security measures will help maintain data integrity and functionality.

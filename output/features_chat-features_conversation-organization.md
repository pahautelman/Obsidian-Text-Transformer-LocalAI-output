### Organizing Conversations with Folders
Folders are a powerful tool for grouping related conversations together, making it easier to access and manage them.

#### Creating a Folder
You can create new folders to store specific conversations. This is particularly useful when you want to keep conversations of similar topics or purposes together.

#### Moving Conversations into Folders
Conversations can be moved into folders by dragging and dropping them. This allows you to structure your workspace in a way that suits your workflow.

> **Example:** If you are managing multiple projects, create separate folders for each project and move relevant conversations into these folders. This helps keep all project-related discussions in one place.

### Organizing Conversations with Tags
Tags provide an additional layer of organization by allowing you to label conversations with keywords or phrases.

#### Adding Tags to Conversations
Tags can be applied to conversations based on their content or purpose. They are flexible and can be added or removed as needed.

#### Using Tags for Searching
Tags make it easy to locate specific conversations using the search feature. You can filter conversations by tags to quickly find those related to specific topics.

> **Example:** If you frequently discuss certain topics, such as "marketing" or "development," tag conversations with these terms. Later, when you search for a specific tag, all relevant conversations will be quickly accessible.

## Summary
Open WebUI offers robust features for organizing conversations through Folders and Tags. Folders help group related discussions, while Tags provide flexible labeling for easy retrieval. These tools enhance workflow efficiency by making it simple to manage and find conversations.

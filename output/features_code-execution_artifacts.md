- Editing and iterating on artifacts
- Use cases for different teams

## Detailed Description

### Overview of Artifacts
Artifacts in Open WebUI are inspired by Claude.AI's Artifacts, allowing users to interact with significant and standalone content generated by an LLM within a chat. This feature enables viewing, modifying, building upon, or referencing substantial pieces of content separately from the main conversation.

### When Does Open WebUI Use Artifacts?
Open WebUI creates artifacts when the generated content meets specific criteria:

- **Renderable Content:**
  - Single-page HTML websites
  - Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images
  - Complete webpages (HTML, JavaScript, CSS)
  - ThreeJS Visualizations and other JavaScript visualization libraries like D3.js

### How Does Open WebUI's Model Create Artifacts?
To use artifacts in Open WebUI, a model must generate content that triggers the rendering process. This involves creating valid HTML, SVG code, or other supported formats for artifact rendering.

### Using Artifacts in Open WebUI
When an artifact is created, it appears in a dedicated window to the right of the main chat. Hereâ€™s how you can interact with artifacts:

- **Editing and Iterating:**
  - Ask an LLM within the chat to edit or iterate on the content.
  - Use the version selector at the bottom left of the Artifact to switch between versions.

- **Updates:**
  - Open WebUI may update existing artifacts based on your messages, displaying the latest content in the artifact window.

- **Actions:**
  - Access additional actions such as copying the content or opening the artifact in full screen from the lower right corner of the Artifact.

### Editing Artifacts
You can make targeted updates or full rewrites to artifacts:

- **Targeted Updates:**
  - Describe specific changes, e.g., "Change the color of the bar in the chart from blue to red."

- **Full Rewrites:**
  - Request major changes affecting most of the content, e.g., "Rewrite this single-page HTML website to be a landing page instead."

### Best Practices
- Be specific about which part of the artifact you want to change.
- Reference unique identifying text around your desired change for targeted updates.
- Consider whether a small update or full rewrite is more appropriate.

### Use Cases

#### Designers:
- Create interactive SVG graphics for UI/UX design.
- Design single-page HTML websites or landing pages.

#### Developers:
- Create simple HTML prototypes or generate SVG icons for projects.

#### Marketers:
- Design campaign landing pages with performance metrics.
- Create SVG graphics for ad creatives or social media posts.

### Examples of Projects

#### Interactive Visualizations
- **Components:** ThreeJS, D3.js, and SVG
- **Benefits:** Create immersive data stories with interactive visualizations. Switch between versions to test different visualization approaches.
- **Example Project:** Build an interactive line chart using ThreeJS to visualize stock prices over time.

#### Single-Page Web Applications
- **Components:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Benefits:** Develop single-page web applications directly within Open WebUI. Edit and iterate on the content using targeted updates and full rewrites.
- **Example Project:** Design a to-do list app with a user interface built using HTML and CSS.

#### Animated SVG Graphics
- **Components:** SVG, ThreeJS
- **Benefits:** Create engaging animated SVG graphics for marketing campaigns or web design. Edit and iterate on the graphics in a single window.
- **Example Project:** Design an animated SVG logo for a company brand.

#### Webpage Prototypes
- **Components:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Benefits:** Build and test webpage prototypes directly within Open WebUI. Switch between versions to compare different design approaches.
- **Example Project:** Develop a prototype for a new e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### Interactive Storytelling
- **Components:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Benefits:** Create interactive stories with scrolling effects, animations, and other interactive elements. Refine the story and test different versions.
- **Example Project:** Build an interactive story about a company's history using scrolling effects and animations.

## Summary

Artifacts in Open WebUI allow users to interact with significant content generated by LLMs within a chat. They support various renderable formats like HTML, SVG, and JavaScript visualizations, enabling teams to create high-quality work products efficiently. Users can edit, iterate, and update artifacts directly within the platform, making it easier to manage complex outputs and revisit important information.

1. **Navigate to the Admin Panel**
   - Log in as an Admin.
2. **Access Settings**
   - Click on the `Settings` tab.
3. **Toggle Community Sharing**
   - Enable `Community Sharing` within the `General settings` tab.

> **Note:** Only Admins can enable community sharing. If disabled, users won't see the option to share chats to the Open WebUI community.

### Sharing Chats
To share a chat:

1. **Select the Chat**
   - Choose the conversation you want to share.
2. **Access Share Options**
   - Click on the three dots that appear when hovering over the chat.
3. **Choose Share Method**
   - Select `Share` and choose between:
     - `Share to Open WebUI Community`
     - `Copy Link`

### Sharing to Open WebUI Community
When sharing to the community:

1. **Upload Chat Snapshot**
   - A new tab opens for uploading the chat to [Open WebUI community website](https://openwebui.com/chats/upload).
2. **Set Access Permissions**
   - Choose from:
     - `Private`: Only you can access.
     - `Public`: Anyone can view messages.
     - `Public, Full History`: Anyone can view full regeneration history.

> **Note:** You can change permission levels anytime via your [openwebui.com](http://openwebui.com) account. Currently, shared chats are not searchable on the community website but future updates may allow public chats to be discoverable.

### Copying a Share Link
When copying a share link:

1. **Generate Unique Link**
   - A unique share link is created.
2. **Important Considerations**
   - The link includes messages at the time of creation.
   - New messages sent after generating the link won't be included unless the link is updated.

> **Note:** Users must have an account and be signed in to view the shared chat. If not, they will be redirected to the login page.

### Viewing Shared Chats
To view a shared chat:

1. **Ensure Account Access**
   - Be signed in to the Open WebUI instance where the link was generated.
2. **Click on Share Link**
   - The chat will display in read-only format.
3. **Text-to-Speech Option**
   - If enabled by the Admin, an audio button may be available for reading messages aloud.

### Updating Shared Chats
To update a shared chat:

1. **Access Share Options**
   - Select the chat and click on `Share`.
2. **Update Share Modal**
   - The modal includes options to:
     - View previously shared chat.
     - Delete the share link.
     - Update and copy the new share link.

### Deleting Shared Chat Links
To delete a shared chat link:

1. **Access Share Options**
   - Select the chat and click on `Share`.
2. **Delete Link**
   - Click on `delete this link` to remove the shared link.

> **Note:** Chats shared to the community platform cannot be deleted but you can change their access level via your [openwebui.com](http://openwebui.com) account.

## Summary
Chat sharing in Open WebUI allows users to share conversations with others, either within the community or via unique links. Admins can enable community sharing, and users can control access permissions for shared chats. The process involves selecting chats, choosing share methods, setting permissions, and managing updates or deletions as needed.

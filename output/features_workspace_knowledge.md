### Overview
The **Knowledge** section in Open WebUI acts as a memory bank, enhancing interactions by storing structured information that the system can reference during chats. This feature makes responses more personalized and contextually aware.

### What is Knowledge?
- **Definition:** A storage area within Open WebUI for saving specific pieces of information or data points.
- **Purpose:** To make responses more accurate and relevant to user needs by referencing saved data.

### Why Use Knowledge?
Knowledge is useful for:
- Remembering project parameters, settings, or notes without repeated reminders.
- Storing personal preferences for chats and responses.
- Creating a coherent, personalized experience by referencing stored information in future conversations.

#### Examples of Stored Data
- **Project Parameters:** Important data points frequently referenced.
- **Custom Commands/Workflows:** Specific settings or commands to apply.
- **Personal Preferences:** Guidelines or rules for Open WebUI to follow in chats.

### How to Use Knowledge in Chats
Accessing stored Knowledge is straightforward:
1. **Reference Saved Data:**
   - Use the `#` symbol followed by the name of the saved data.
2. **Automatic Recall:**
   - Open WebUI can automatically recall project details or apply custom preferences during chats.

#### Examples
- **Project Discussions:** Open WebUI recalls specified project details.
- **Custom Preferences:** Apply formality levels or preferred phrasing in responses.

### Setting Up Your Knowledge Base

1. **Navigate to the Knowledge Section:**
   - User-friendly and intuitive design.
2. **Add Entries:**
   - Input information you want Open WebUI to remember (specific or broad).
3. **Save and Apply:**
   - Saved Knowledge is immediately accessible for enhanced chat interactions.

### Admin vs. User Access
- **Admins:** Can add knowledge to the workspace, which users can access.
- **Users:** Do not have direct access to the workspace but can use the stored knowledge in chats.

## Summary
The Knowledge section in Open WebUI serves as a memory bank for storing data that enhances chat interactions. By keeping important details saved, you ensure a personalized and contextually aware experience. Reference stored data directly in chats using `#` followed by the name of the knowledge entry.

### Effortless Setup
Effortlessly install Open WebUI using Docker, Kubernetes, Podman, Helm Charts for a seamless experience. This setup supports both :ollama image with bundled Ollama and :cuda with CUDA support.

### Guided Initial Setup
The initial setup process is clear and includes explicit instructions for creating an admin account during the first-time setup.

### OpenAI API Integration
Effortlessly integrate OpenAI-compatible APIs for versatile conversations alongside Ollama models. Customize the OpenAI API URL to seamlessly integrate with various third-party applications.

### Granular Permissions and User Groups
Administrators can create detailed user roles, user groups, and permissions across the workspace. This granularity enhances security and allows for customized user experiences.

### Responsive Design
Enjoy a seamless experience across desktop PCs, laptops, and mobile devices.

### Progressive Web App for Mobile
Experience a native progressive web application on your mobile device with offline access on localhost or a personal domain, and a smooth user interface. To set up a PWA, you'll need some understanding of technologies like Linux, Docker, and reverse proxies such as Nginx, Caddy, or Traefik.

### Full Markdown and LaTeX Support
Elevate your LLM experience with comprehensive Markdown, LaTex, and Rich Text capabilities for enriched interaction.

### Model Builder
Easily create custom models from base Ollama models directly from Open WebUI. Create and add custom characters and agents, customize model elements, and import models effortlessly through Open WebUI Community integration.

### Local and Remote RAG Integration
Dive into the future of chat interactions with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology within your chats. Documents can be loaded into the Documents tab of the Workspace, after which they can be accessed using the pound key [#] before a query, or by starting the prompt with the pound key [#], followed by a URL for webpage content integration.

### Web Search for RAG
You can perform web searches using various search providers and inject the results directly into your local Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) experience.

### Web Browsing Capabilities
Integrate websites seamlessly into your chat experience by using the # command followed by a URL. This feature enables the incorporation of web content directly into your conversations, thereby enhancing the richness and depth of your interactions.

### Image Generation Integration
Seamlessly incorporate image generation capabilities to enrich your chat experience with dynamic visual content.

### Concurrent Model Utilization
Effortlessly engage with multiple models simultaneously, harnessing their unique strengths for optimal responses. Leverage a diverse set of model modalities in parallel to enhance your experience.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Ensure secure access with restricted permissions. Only authorized individuals can access your Ollama, while model creation and pulling rights are exclusively reserved for administrators.

### Multilingual Support
Experience Open WebUI in your preferred language with internationalization (i18n) support. We invite you to join us in expanding our supported languages! We're actively seeking contributors!

### Continuous Updates
We are committed to improving Open WebUI with regular updates, fixes, and new features.

## Summary
Open WebUI offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to enhance user experience, security, and functionality.

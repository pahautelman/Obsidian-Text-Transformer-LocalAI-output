## Detailed Description

### Local Chat Sharing
Generate and share chat links between users in an efficient and seamless manner, thereby enhancing collaboration and communication.

### RLHF Annotation
Enhance the impact of your messages by rating them with either a thumbs up or thumbs down AMD provide a rating for the response on a scale of 1-10, followed by the option to provide textual feedback, facilitating the creation of datasets for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Utilize your messages to train or fine-tune models, all while ensuring the confidentiality of locally saved data.

### Comprehensive Feedback Export
Export feedback history data to JSON for seamless integration with RLHF processing and further analysis, providing valuable insights for improvement.

### Community Sharing
Share your chat sessions with the Open WebUI Community by clicking the Share to Open WebUI Community button. This feature allows you to engage with other users and collaborate on the platform. To utilize this feature, please sign-in to your Open WebUI Community account. Sharing your chats fosters a vibrant community, encourages knowledge sharing, and facilitates joint problem-solving. Please note that community sharing of chat sessions is an optional feature. Only Admins can toggle this feature on or off in the Admin Settings > Settings > General menu.

### Community Leaderboard
Compete and track your performance in real-time with our leaderboard system, which utilizes the ELO rating system and allows for optional sharing of feedback history.

### Model Evaluation Arena
Conduct blind A/B testing of models directly from the Admin Settings for a true side-by-side comparison, making it easier to find the best model for your needs.

### Topic-Based Rankings
Discover more accurate rankings with our experimental topic-based re-ranking system, which adjusts leaderboard standings based on tag similarity in feedback.

### Unified and Collaborative Workspace
Access and manage all your model files, prompts, documents, tools, and functions in one convenient location, while also enabling multiple users to collaborate and contribute to models, knowledge, prompts, or tools, streamlining your workflow and enhancing teamwork.

## Summary
Open WebUI fosters collaboration through features like local chat sharing, RLHF annotation, feedback export, community engagement, leaderboards, model evaluation, topic-based rankings, and a unified workspace. These collaborative tools enhance user interaction and productivity within the platform.

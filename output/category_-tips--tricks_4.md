# Improve Local LLM Performance with Dedicated Task Models

## Key Concepts
- Local LLM performance
- Dedicated task models
- Automated features (title generation, tag creation, autocomplete, search query generation)

## Detailed Description

### Overview
Open WebUI offers several automated features to enhance user experience. However, these features can generate multiple simultaneous requests to your local model, potentially impacting performance on systems with limited resources.

### Strategies for Improvement
To mitigate this issue and improve local LLM performance:

1. **Use Dedicated Task Models**   - Assign specific tasks to dedicated models.
2. **Optimize Request Handling**  - Manage request load efficiently.

## Summary
This document discusses strategies to enhance the performance of local LLMs in Open WebUI by using dedicated task models and optimizing request handling, ensuring a smoother user experience even on resource-constrained systems.

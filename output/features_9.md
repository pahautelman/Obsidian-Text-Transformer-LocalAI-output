### Simplified API Key Management
Easily generate and manage secret keys to leverage Open WebUI with OpenAI libraries, streamlining integration and development.

### HTTP/S Proxy Support
Configure network settings easily using the http_proxy or https_proxy environment variable. These variables, if set, should contain the URLs for HTTP and HTTPS proxies, respectively.

### External Ollama Server Connectivity
Seamlessly link to an external Ollama server hosted on a different address by configuring the environment variable.

### Flexible Database Integration
Seamlessly connect to custom databases, including SQLite, Postgres, and multiple vector databases like Milvus, using environment variables for flexible and scalable data management.

### External Speech-to-Text Support
The addition of external speech-to-text (STT) services provides enhanced flexibility, allowing users to choose their preferred provider for seamless interaction.

### Remote ChromaDB Support
Extend the capabilities of your database by connecting to remote ChromaDB servers.

### Multiple Ollama Instance Load Balancing
Effortlessly distribute chat requests across multiple Ollama instances for enhanced performance and reliability.

### Advanced Load Balancing and Reliability
Utilize enhanced load balancing capabilities, stateless instances with full Redis support, and automatic web socket re-connection to promote better performance, reliability, and scalability in WebUI, ensuring seamless and uninterrupted interactions across multiple instances.

### Experimental S3 Support
Enable stateless WebUI instances with S3 support for enhanced scalability and balancing heavy workloads.

### OAuth Management for User Groups
Enhance control and scalability in collaborative environments with group-level management via OAuth integration.

## Summary
Open WebUI provides robust integration and security features, including support for multiple APIs, simplified key management, proxy settings, external server connectivity, flexible database integration, speech-to-text services, load balancing, and OAuth management. These features ensure a secure and scalable environment for user interactions.
